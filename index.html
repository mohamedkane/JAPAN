    <p>Transportation expenses will make up a considerable part of your travel budget. They consist of the cost for your flight to Japan as well as urban and possibly long distance transportation inside Japan.Japan has an efficient public transport network, especially within its large cities. The Japanese transport system including Shinkansen (the famous Bullet Train) is characterized by its punctuality, excellent service and its cleanliness. according to th e website "Planning a two week trip throughout Japan for late April and I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to get around Japan. I've read quite a bit about the Rail Pass for traveling between major cities, though I'm a little confused on how transportation is provided within the cities. Tokyo and Kyoto for example, will a JAR pass cover subway or metro trains within the city or is there a different pass for that? Will the same pass work in each city or each is operated by a different agency? Should I purchase these passes ahead of time, just pay as I go in each city, or something else? Much appreciated."</p>
